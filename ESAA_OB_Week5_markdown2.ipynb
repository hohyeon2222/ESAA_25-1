order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                      Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n41

    There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .\\n44

having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

quality .\\n72

      The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

   However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow

 I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                            As soon as I'd clicked the

reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

.\\n4                                                                                                                                                  It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5                                                                                                                                 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7

to put the device to sleep .\\n8

interior of the button to get it to click .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                Combine that with the smaller button sizes and one major source of frustration has been instantly eliminated !\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                 The change in the hinging and size of the buttons is major plus and would make it hard to go back to the K1 .\\n13                                                                                                                                                 sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                           ,  The 5, way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version .\\n15                                                                                                       Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

                                                            That 5, way button is magical .\\n18

.\\n19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n20

major improvement .\\n21

pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23

pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

                                                                                                                                                                                           It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n29

                                                                                                                                 if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

better .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

lot less sensitive .\\n34

took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37

up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

                                  Every K2 button has a satisfying \\n42                                                                                                                                       Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61

.\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63

me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65

impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67

I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70

make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n74



.\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78

convex tops .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .\\n80

           My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .\\n84

                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86

                            Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                        The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Buttons are not hard to press for me .\\n93

.\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96

and frustratingly easy to advance the page .\\n100

                                                                                                                                                                                       significant

text .\\n109                                                                                                       The only thing you can do is rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n110

screen went blank .\\n111                                                                                                                                            While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n112                                                                                                                           My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book in the cover isn't a problem as the front cover readily folds around to the back so that it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .\\n114

just have to push downward on the square button .\\n115

                                                   This enables you to pick up the device with the edges without pressing any buttons .\\n129

say, flipping a page in a real book while lying in bed, having said page get caught up on the covers, and having to adjust to get it squared away .\\n131

Your finger can rest on the  next page  button, and a simple click is all you need to advance .\\n138

or whenever, just one hand gives you good access to all the buttons even while you are holding the device .\\n140

seen, however, is whether the Kindle 2 will be plagued with having to be reset as frequently as the Kindle, nor did I see a reset button .\\n159

visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving style .\\n12

hard cheap ones which are very very uncomfortable and give me back pain .\\n17                                                                                                                                             If you keep in mind that the Camry is a comfort car, you may even enjoy the experience .\\n18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .\\n19

it .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                    Very comfortable, great styling .\\n22                                                                                                                                     I was surprised by how quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23                                                                                                                                   This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage \\n24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25

                                                                                                                              You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?\\n28                                                                                                                                                    I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                                                                                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                       Front seats are not comfortable on long trip .\\n40                                                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3

Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90

has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

                                                 My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107

                                                                                                                                                       Top notch rating on interior comfort .\\n109

         I purchased a Camry LE approximately 2 months ago, it's a smooth comfortable ride .\\n112

3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n14

sized laptops are so freaking bulky, heavy, and the battery wouldnt even make it though one of my evening classes .\\n29

                                        Surprisingly readable screen for the size .\\n30

normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n31

was probably unavoidable .\\n32

                           1 inches is a bit small, so make sure you check some 10 inch models out at Best Buy or Office Max to make sure you're ok with the size .\\n34

operates Windows efficiently, staying incredibly cool compared to the instant burn, your, lap sauna of my full, sized HP Pavillion .\\n35

                                       Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .\\n36

   Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n37

than a full, size Vista laptop we have .\\n38

for me .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           It's 92% the size of a regular keyboard, and my somewhat larger, than, average male hands have adapted completely in a few weeks .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Some reviewers have complained about the physical size of the battery extrusion from the bottom of the netbook .\\n41

        Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .\\n42                                                                                                                     I originally bought the EEE to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere, but have started exclusively using the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .\\n43

adjustment when typing .\\n45



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n48

used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          One of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                Also tried a full size Logitech Trackman   and a little wired Logitech notebook mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I'm using it with a Xion 2 fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And you can't beat the price with a stick compared to a full size laptop or desktop .\\n54

really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n55

                                                            Like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike Qosmio 17  which is almost same size .\\n67

regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n71                                                                                                                                             I was also worried that it's small size would equate to something delicate, but I am rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .\\n72

                                                               The Garmin Nuvi 255W connects to satellites extremely fast, , So when I get in my car and turn it on, we're pretty much ready to go immediately .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It picks up the satellites quickly  , routes fast, has good animation maybe 6, 8 frames a second ?\\n3

GPS to make satellite connections quickly .\\n4                                                                                                                                                The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hotfix   to lock on to satellite signals works well .\\n6                                                                                                                                                         On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8

the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !\\n10

signals and very responsive with the user interface   .\\n11

loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14                                                                                      by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .\\n15

 hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .\\n17

unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n37

                I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .\\n39                                                                                                                         It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When powered up initially it does a one, time search for satellites .\\n41

it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46

battery life .\\n12

the P series really comes done to how much you care about a slight speed different  , a small battery life difference, a better web cam, Bluetooth, and or the netbook sleeve .\\n14

  Since the battery life difference is minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard .\\n17

port, you get covered usb ports which is annoying, and you get less than half the battery life .\\n18

                          It has the longest battery life of any notebook .\\n19

experienced issues with the battery and or power supply .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                   Eventually, I noticed that most of these critical reviews referred to the battery or to the charging brick and most of those were describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                  They didn't attach the power cord properly or the charging time was too short and some didn't seem to understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .\\n22

computer .\\n23

                                                                                                                             I suppose that is one reason why I kept gravitating to the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU as I explored the reviews for other brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the Asus Eee PC .\\n25

                                    The main difference is probably the ten hour battery that is unique and ships with the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU .\\n26

                              I wanted the netbook to use on long airplane flights so the long life battery was a real plus for me .\\n27

sleek and that big battery doesn't stick out on the back edge like the other netbook high capacity batteries do .\\n28

  I like it a lot  the battery and charger problems I feared so much have not materialized .\\n29

                                                        The backlighting is definitely a factor in the longer battery charge life, but it also makes for a very nice bright picture .\\n35

speakers are very weak for media use, but there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .\\n74

                                    I expected six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up .\\n77

never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

and turn down the screen brightness .\\n156  One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157
